# Contributing to Setup Your Mac

<br>

## Welcome and Thank You!
Welcome and thank you for considering contributing _your_ unique talents to [Setup Your Mac](https://snelson.us/sym); this project wouldn't be what it is today without the assistance of MacAdmins worldwide just like you.

## How you can contribute

### 1. Testing
Testing is an ongoing need to help ensure new features both _work_ as expected **and** don't _break_ anything else.

### 2. Proof-reading
At times, it feels like _documenting_ how MacAdmins can implement SYM in their environment takes as much — or more — time and effort as does writing the `code` behind Setup Your Mac. If you're willing to proof-read (or even _write_) documentation, please [direct-message Dan](https://macadmins.slack.com/team/U120FAHK2).

### 3. Feature Requests
Even if you can't _yet_ write `code` you're comfortable sharing with the world, you have ideas. When you're ready, you're invited to formally share your ideas in the form of a [Feature Request](https://github.com/dan-snelson/Setup-Your-Mac/issues).

> Please note that while all requests are welcome, finding available cycles to custom-code a feature we won’t use in our production environment is always challenging.

### 4. Pull Requests
[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) are the lifeblood of all open-source projects.

If you're hesitant to submit a PR to the [main SYM script](Setup-Your-Mac-via-Dialog.bash), contributing a [Remote Validation](Validations/README.md) is a great place to start.
